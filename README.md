# Diabetes Detector
  This is a Python-based project aimed at detecting the likelihood of a person having diabetes using machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI/ML) techniques.
  The project predicts the probability of diabetes based on various health-related parameters such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and other factors.

# Instructions to Run the Program#
# Prerequisites
    Python 3.x or higher
    pip (Python package manager)
# Steps
  1.Clone the Repository:
  
    > git clone https://github.com/your-username/Diabetes-Detector.git
    > cd Diabetes-Detector
  2.Install Dependencies: Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
  
    > python -m venv venv
    > source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use venv\Scripts\activate
   Install required libraries:
   
    > pip install -r requirements.txt
  3.Running the Program: To run the diabetes prediction model, use the following command:
  
    > python src/app.py
  The program will ask for input values like age, BMI, blood pressure, etc., and provide the prediction result on whether the user is at risk of diabetes.

# Dataset
 
  The dataset used for training is available in the data/dataset.csv file. This dataset contains several medical parameters along with labels indicating whether the person has diabetes or not.
  It is used to train the machine learning model.

# Technologies Used
   Python: Primary programming language for developing the application.
   scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and model training.
   pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
   numpy: For numerical operations and calculations.
   Flask (optional): For building a web interface to interact with the model.
   matplotlib (optional): For visualizing the data and results.

# Future Scope
  Improved Model: Incorporating additional data sources and advanced machine learning models like neural networks for higher accuracy.
  Real-time Data Collection: Integrating the system with wearables or medical devices to collect real-time health data for diabetes prediction.
  Mobile App Integration: Creating a mobile application for users to check their diabetes risk based on their health data.
  Personalized Recommendations: Providing lifestyle and dietary recommendations based on the prediction results.
  Global Dataset Integration: Expanding the model to work with global datasets for better prediction across diverse populations.
